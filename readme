Heatmap Visualization
This project demonstrates how to create a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix of a dataset using Matplotlib. A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where individual values are represented as colors within a matrix.

Heatmap Visualization

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Matplotlib
NumPy
How to Use
Clone the repository or download the heatmap_viz.py file.

Replace the sample correlation matrix in the data variable with your own dataset's correlation matrix.

Run the script using Python:
The script will generate a heatmap visualization for the provided correlation matrix.
Features
Heatmap: Visualizes the correlation matrix using colors, where darker colors represent higher correlations and lighter colors represent lower correlations.
Colorbar: Includes a colorbar to show the correlation values corresponding to different colors.
Customization
You can customize the project by:

Replacing the correlation matrix: Replace the data variable with your dataset's correlation matrix. Make sure the matrix is square, with rows and columns corresponding to the same features.
Changing the color map: Modify the cmap parameter in the imshow() function to choose a different colormap. You can find available colormaps in the Matplotlib documentation.
Adjusting tick labels: Update the xticks and yticks to match the row and column labels of your dataset.
Dependencies
Matplotlib
NumPy
